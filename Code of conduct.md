## Code of Conduct


We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for our learning, working, and cooperating. All our group members are expected to consistently demonstrate respect and courtesy towards one another.

For our positive and harmonious project environment, we have established the following code of conduct that we expect everyone in our group to uphold:

- Respect and courtesy: We expect all participants to be respectful and courteous to other group members. All team communications should be conducted in a professional, welcoming, and inclusive manner, devoid of malicious speech, discriminatory information, or personal attacks.

- Openness and collaboration: We aim to foster an open and collaborative environment where every participant is encouraged to contribute their ideas and advice. We hope all group members can share expertise, collaborate effectively, and work together towards achieving our common goal of successfully completing the project.

If you observe any violation of our code of conduct, please address the issue directly and respectfully with the individual(s) involved. If the situation persists, please bring it to the attention of the team leader or designated authority. We are committed to resolving conflicts promptly and impartially to maintain a positive working environment for all.

Our ultimate goal is to create a positive and supportive atmosphere where everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute towards the success of our project.
