# Real Estate Decision-Making Dashboard Proposal

## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Real Estate Analytics Firm

Target audience: Homebuyers and Investors

The New York City real estate market is complex and fast-moving, challenging buyers and investors to make informed decisions. Our proposed data visualization app aims to simplify this process by enabling users to interactively explore property listings across the city. Users can compare prices, property types, and neighborhoods at a glance, with advanced filters to refine their search based on specific needs. Additionally, the app highlights leading brokers in each area, making it easier to connect with experts. This streamlined tool is designed to empower our audience with the insights needed for smarter real estate investments and purchases in NYC.

## Section 2: Description of the Data

We will be visualizing a dataset comprising real estate listings from various boroughs of New York City. The dataset encompasses a collection of variables related to property listings, such as the brokerage type (broker_title), sale price (price), number of bedrooms (beds), number of bathrooms (bath), and property size (property_size). Each listing also includes detailed locational information, like the street address (property_address), state, and county (main_addr_administr), alongside geospatial coordinates (latitude, longitude).

Our dataset includes both categorical variables, which describe the type and location of the property, and numerical variables, such as price and room counts. We will be focusing on a subset of these variables to visualize trends in pricing, the prevalence of property types, and the geographical distribution of listings. Additionally, we intend to create new variables that could provide further insights, such as price per square foot (price_per_sqft). The derived variables will aid in a more granular analysis of the real estate market. Our visualizations aim to elucidate patterns and correlations within the housing market of New York City, potentially serving as a tool for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals to make informed decisions.
