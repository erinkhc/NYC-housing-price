The navigation bar on the left side of the page serves as the quick navigation tool for the entire Dash application, acting as the starting point for users. It allows users to access housing price information based on different data views (maps, types, areas), thus exploring the market from multiple dimensions.

The interactive map in the center displays the geographical distribution of properties, cleverly conveying information about property prices and sizes through the color and size of the dots. The gradient of colours from light to dark maps the price range from low to high, while the size of the dots is directly linked to the actual area of the properties, providing a seamless interpretation experience for users.

When users hover their mouse over a point on the map, it displays detailed data for each property, such as address, area, pricing, and the specific layout of the house. These instantly displayed data points ensure that users have sufficient information when making decisions.

After a point on the map is clicked, the lower right area of the page will display richer information, such as key infrastructure near the property. This includes medical institutions, leisure parks, and shopping centers, which are crucial for assessing the convenience of living near the property.

Furthermore, the filter in the upper right corner offers customized search functionality, allowing users to narrow down their search based on specific locations, house types, and price ranges, making the process of finding the ideal property more direct and personalized.

## Description

The first page of this dashboard contains an interactive map with a filter. By clicking on the red icons on the map, users can view detailed property information like area, price, district, etc. And they can filter their desired house on the map by region, type, and price. In the lower half page, the left-side filter allows users to select the type of house they are interested in, which updates the boxplot to display the price distributions for each region of New York of the selected housing type. The pie chart illustrates the market shares of this housing type across different regions of New York.

The second page of the dashboard offers a window into each locality of New York. It showcases essential data like average real estate prices, income statistics, and amenities (e.g. parks). This interactive map highlights the socio-economic pulse of the districts. While users select one locality, predictive tools on the left-bottom can predict the housing price range factoring in bedrooms, bathrooms, and space they selected. The bar plot in the bottom right also lists top-5 real estate brokers by the volume of their listings, guiding buyers to the most active agents in the selected locality.
