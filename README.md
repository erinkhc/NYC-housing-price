# NYC-housing-price

This dashboard provides users with a comprehensive overview of the New York real estate market, allowing them to browse property information through interactive maps and filtering features. The predictive tools and real estate agent rankings assist users in making informed purchasing decisions.

## Description

The first page of this dashboard contains an interactive map with a filter. By clicking on the red icons on the map, users can view detailed property information like area, price, district, etc. And they can filter their desired house on the map by region, type, and price. In the lower half page, the left-side filter allows users to select the type of house they are interested in, which updates the boxplot to display the price distributions for each region of New York of the selected housing type. The pie chart illustrates the market shares of this housing type across different regions of New York.

The second page of the dashboard offers a window into each locality of New York. It showcases essential data like average real estate prices, income statistics, and amenities (e.g. parks). This interactive map highlights the socio-economic pulse of the districts. While users select one locality, predictive tools on the left-bottom can predict the housing price range factoring in bedrooms, bathrooms, and space they selected. The bar plot in the bottom right also lists top-5 real estate brokers by the volume of their listings, guiding buyers to the most active agents in the selected locality.
